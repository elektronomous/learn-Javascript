[VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS]
= variables are data container or data storage which holds some data.
= You can change the value of the variables.
= you declare a variable in JavaScript like this:

        let userName = "Faza";
= or
        let firstName = "faza",
            lastName = "akbar";

  = "let" is the JavaScript keyword which tell the javascript we're declaring a variable
  = userName is the variable name, which you can refer back to it in later execution code.
  = "Faza" is the data that it's hold.
= You can reassign the variable to another value, without using let.

        userName = "Akbar";

= You can create variable where you can't change its state(its value, its data).
= This variables called constant variables.

        const userName = "Faza";
        userName = "Akbar";         // ERROR!!!

[VARIABLES NAMING]

= you can't start the variable name using number
= you can't naming your variable using the JavaScript keyword (let, const, for, in, if, and so on).
= you can only seperate variable name using _.
= the convention way when you have more than one word variable name is using
  the camel case:

        let userName = "Akbar";
        let isThereApple = true;
        let getValue = 20;

= you can start variable name using $ symbol.
= you can start variable name using _ symbol.
= you need to use the double colon(;) to end your statement.
  
        let userName = "akbar";     // you state that you have variable named userName which value is "akbar"
